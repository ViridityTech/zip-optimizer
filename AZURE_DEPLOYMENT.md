# Azure VM Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy the Clinic ZIP Code Optimizer and Visualizer on an Azure Virtual Machine.

## Prerequisites

1. Azure VM with Python 3.7+ installed
2. Network Security Group (NSG) configured to allow inbound traffic on ports 8501 and 8502
3. Project files uploaded to the VM, including:
   - All Python scripts and configuration files
   - `Zipcodes Info csv.csv` (ZIP code demographics data file)
   - `usa_zip_codes_geo_100m.json` (ZIP code boundaries GeoJSON file)
   - Note: Clinic addresses and optimized assignments are uploaded through the web interface

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Run Both Applications (Recommended)
```bash
python3 start_azure_apps.py
```
This will start both the Optimizer and Visualizer simultaneously:
- Optimizer: `http://20.127.202.39:8501`
- Visualizer: `http://20.127.202.39:8502`

### Option 2: Run Individual Applications
```bash
# For Optimizer only
python3 run_optimizer_azure.py

# For Visualizer only  
python3 run_visualizer_azure.py
```

## Data Files

The applications use a hybrid approach for data files:

### Required Files for Optimizer:
1. **Clinic Addresses CSV** (Upload Required) - Contains clinic information with columns:
   - `Clinic` - Name of the clinic
   - `latitude` - Latitude coordinate  
   - `longitude` - Longitude coordinate
   - `Type` - Type of clinic (Rural/Urban)

2. **ZIP Code Demographics CSV** (Project File) - Must be present on the server as `Zipcodes Info csv.csv`:
   - `zip` - ZIP code
   - `population_center_latitude` - Latitude of population center
   - `population_center_longitude` - Longitude of population center
   - `population_count` - Population count
   - `percent_bachelors_degree` - Percentage with bachelor's degree
   - `percent_graduate_degree` - Percentage with graduate degree
   - `percent_population_in_poverty` - Percentage in poverty
   - `median_household_income` - Median household income

### Required Files for Visualizer:
1. **Optimized Assignments CSV** (Upload Required) - Generated by the Optimizer
2. **ZIP Code Boundaries GeoJSON** (Project File) - Must be present on the server as `usa_zip_codes_geo_100m.json`

## Azure Network Security Group Configuration

You need to open the following ports in your Azure NSG:

### For HTTP Access (Recommended)
1. Go to Azure Portal → Your VM → Networking
2. Add inbound security rules:
   - **Port 8501** (for Optimizer)
     - Source: Any
     - Destination port ranges: 8501
     - Protocol: TCP
     - Action: Allow
   - **Port 8502** (for Visualizer)  
     - Source: Any
     - Destination port ranges: 8502
     - Protocol: TCP
     - Action: Allow

## Accessing the Applications

Once running, access the applications via:
- **Optimizer**: `http://20.127.202.39:8501`
- **Visualizer**: `http://20.127.202.39:8502`

## Usage Workflow

### Optimizer
1. Navigate to `http://20.127.202.39:8501`
2. **Upload Clinic Data**: Upload the clinic addresses CSV (ZIP code data loads automatically from project file)
3. **Authenticate with Salesforce**: Enter your Salesforce credentials
4. **Configure Parameters**: Set weights and optimization parameters
5. **Run Optimization**: Click "Run Optimization" to process
6. **Download Results**: Download the optimized assignments CSV

### Visualizer  
1. Navigate to `http://20.127.202.39:8502`
2. **Upload File**: Upload the optimized assignments CSV (from Optimizer) - ZIP code boundaries load automatically
3. **Generate Maps**: Click "Generate Maps"
4. **Download Maps**: Download the ZIP file containing HTML maps for each clinic

## Running as a Service (Optional)

To keep the applications running even after disconnecting from SSH:

### Using nohup
```bash
nohup python3 start_azure_apps.py > app.log 2>&1 &
```

### Using screen
```bash
screen -S caravel-apps
python3 start_azure_apps.py
# Press Ctrl+A, then D to detach
# To reattach: screen -r caravel-apps
```

### Using systemd (Advanced)
Create a systemd service file for automatic startup and management.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Connection refused"**
   - Check if the NSG rules are configured correctly
   - Verify the application is running: `ps aux | grep streamlit`

2. **"Module not found"**
   - Make sure requirements.txt is in the same directory
   - Run: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

3. **Port already in use**
   - Kill existing processes: `pkill -f streamlit`
   - Or use different ports by modifying the scripts

4. **File upload issues**
   - Ensure uploaded files have the correct format and required columns
   - Check file size limits (Streamlit default is 200MB per file)
   - Verify file encoding is UTF-8

### Checking Logs
```bash
# If running with nohup
tail -f app.log

# If running in foreground, check the console output
```

## Security Considerations

- Consider using HTTPS in production
- Restrict NSG rules to specific IP ranges if possible
- Use Azure Application Gateway for additional security layers
- Consider using Azure Container Instances or App Service for production deployments
- Be mindful of data uploaded through the interface - ensure it doesn't contain sensitive information
- Consider implementing user authentication for production use

## Performance Tips

- Use a VM with sufficient CPU and memory (Standard_B2s or larger recommended)
- File uploads are processed in memory - ensure adequate RAM for large datasets
- Consider using Azure Files or Blob Storage for very large data files
- Monitor resource usage through Azure Monitor

## Advantages of Cloud Deployment

- **No local data dependencies**: Users can upload their own data files
- **Centralized access**: Multiple users can access the same application
- **Scalable**: Can handle multiple simultaneous users
- **Always available**: No need for local setup or maintenance
- **Version control**: Single deployment ensures everyone uses the same version
